# Light-Em-All

LightEmAll is a maze-like, problem-solving game that heavily involves user interaction. The game starts with a board of randomized wires and the goal is to connect all the wires and allow the power station to distribute the power to the entire board. The user must press on tiles to rotate the wires (90 degrees clockwise) until they connect with neighboring tiles. As wires branching from the power station connect, Dijkstra's Algorithm figures out the best way to fill the wires with power until there is a dead end. The user can also move the power station left, right, up, and down the board on connected wires to find the best location where power is distributed to all the wires. Once all the wires are connected and powered, the game will display a win screen.
